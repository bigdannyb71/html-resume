        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>I want to help people realize that they are not who we were in the past! We are all complex beings that are ever evolving, and as such we need to be able to continuously embrace those changes we are experiencing. In my opinion, the best way to do this is to continuously evaluate "who" you are so you can make today's decisions, not based on what has or hasn't worked in the past, based on what is best for the you you are right now! Hopefully by doing this I can help them to live the best life possible, now, and every day in the future!</p>
