<body><h1>Getting to Know Me</h1>
    <h2>The Life and Times of Danny Burdess</h2>
        <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p>I was born in Pittsburgh, PA, and from birth until I was 13 years old I lived on the North Side of Pittsburgh, or as it is now called "The Northshore". At that time it was a good blue collar neighborhood, filled with friendly, hardworking, hardnosed, tough people. The neighborhood isn't quite the same anymore, but I digress. I grew up in a household being raised by a single mother, she worked hard, and for the first eight years of my life we lived with my grandparents and my 2 aunts and an uncle. It was tight in a 4 bedroom house, but we were all very close, figuratively and literally. My grandmother was a great cook, as was my mother, so I grew up a fat kid. Some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of going to baseball games with my grandfather, and then stopping for a hot dog and an ice ball (snowcone) on the way home, or going to a movie on a Saturday afternoon with my aunt. 
            <br>When I was eight my mother and I moved out on our own. We moved across the street from my grandparents. Big Move!! Not much changed, my mother still had a great support system in place, and literally a stones throw away. We lived there until I was 13, and through those years the neighborhood was slowly changing for the worst. Then on New Years Eve 1984 a fight at the neighborhood nuisance bar overflowed into the street, and as I opened the front door to scream "Happy New Year" while banging pots and pans, I saw a man get stabbed in the head on my front stoop. That was when mom decided it was time to move. She was an Office Manager at a trucking company on Neville Island, which was about 5 miles west of the city, so that's where we moved. Niville Island was a very nice community, a stark change from where I grew up, and thanks to public transportation I still spent much of my free time, and every weekend staying with my grandparents on the northside, and hanging out with my old friends. I had some friends at school, but the bulk were my still my buddies I grew up with. Like they say "You can thake the boy out of the Northside, but you can't take the Northside out of the boy!".To this day most of my remaining friends are the guys I knew all my life from the Northside, but Neville Island is my home. I still live there, and absolutely love this quiet little community. 
            <br>From The time I was 13 i lived here on the island, and graduated from Cornell High School in the summer of 1989. I had a lot of great memories of those years including attending Parkway West Vo Tech's Culinary Arts Program, and performing with the school's theater group in several productions including Godspell. That love of theater has been a constant in my life, be it performing professionally in Murder Mystery Dinner Theater productions or in Community Theater productions.
        </p>
        <h3>Adulthood</h3>
            <p>Once I graduated high school, I went on to train at The International Culinary Academy, which included a week long certificate program at LaVerenne Cooking School in Paris, FR. This was an amazing opportunity, and I loved every minute of that experience. Upon graduation I went on to work at several restaurants in Pittsburgh, including G.P Robinsons/Brickerville, Rennick's Airport Hilton Inn, and Hohman's Restaurants. 
            <br>Next I attended Duquesne University to pursue my lifelong love of learning, and decided I wanted to major in Psychology, then in my second semester, I took a class to fill my English requirement, and it completely changed my mind. Initially I took the class because it was one that met a requirement in english, it fit into an opening in my planned schedule, and it was Medieval Literature, and from the time I was around 12 i played Dungeons & Dragons, so why not! That decision added another learning path. The professor I had for that class was, and still is the best professor I ever studied under. After taking the first of three classes of her classes that I would go on to attend, I added English Literature as a second major. During this phase in my life I was also working as a Police Dispatcher for The Neville Township Police Department. As it was a quiet community it afforded me the ability to serve my community, while making some money, and giving me some much needed quiet time to study. Unfortunately due to some ill timed family health issues, and some financial constraints, I was unable to complete my degrees, and fell short by about 32 credits. I never did get around to finishing the Bachelors Degrees, but maybe I will someday! From that point I spent many years in sales, mostly in-home sales, but some retail, and even some auto sales. I worked for many companies, including:
                <ul><li>Empire Today</li>
                    <li>AIL Insurance Company</li>
                    <li>Craftmatic</li>
                    <li>CarHop</li>
                    <li>Mattress Discounters</li>
                </ul> 
            <br>In most of these companies I also had a role in training some of the new reps when they came on board. I began to realize that as good as I had always been at sales, I might actually be better at training others to do what I had learned to do. I enjoyed it, and the people I was training were thriving, and were clearly getting value from my style, whatever it was. I was really getting tired of the road warrior thing with in-home sales, and I really couldn't match the money with retail sales, so I decided to go into health insurance, but not into sales, into customer service, which was just an inroad for me to land a gig as a trainer, or in that general vicinity of the corporate world. I landed a job at a company that offered a dual eligibility plan, which for those of you who don't know, is a plan for medicare recipients who also qualify for low income medicaid programs. While there I was involved in several aspects oftraining and quality control for new customer service reps. including being instrumental in the creation of The Mentoring Program, and being the team lead on the Transitions, and Development Team.
            <br>During this phase in my life I decided to lose weight, as I said earlier I was always a fat kid, and nothing had changed, I was arouind 375 pounds. I changed the way I eat, and that really wasn't that hard, I knew how to cook, and was willing to make changes to my diet because the food still tasted good. For me the tough part was finding an exerxise plan I could stick with. As I said earlier I was always into D&D, and acting had been a constant, so I stumbled across a local theater group called Stage & Steel Productions who was holding auditions for an original play about a group of D&D players, and their interactions, as well as the adventure their characters were having, and it was all being performed simultaneously on a two tiered stage. I auditioned, got the lead non-combat role, and was hooked. For the next 5 years or so, I performed in 3 shows a year with that group, and in every show but my first, I had a combat role, which meant learning to swordfight. As a matter of fact I went from 0 swordfights in my first show to 5 swordfights in my second! Well after the first three years of nearly year round swordfighting practice to the tune of 4-5 hours per week, I lost 195 pounds! I had reached my weight loss goal, and felt better than I ever had in my entire life, and then....

        <h3>Middle Age (In Progress)</h3>
            <p>
            <br>For some unknown reason, my body rebelled against me getting healthy, and over the next 3 years I was diagnosed with several autoimmune disorders and the complications that go along with them. First I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, and was having some digestive issues as well. The doctors assured me the digestive issues were due to a gall bladder that was full of gall stones, so out came the gall bladder, but my digestive issues did not stop. I struggled with maintaining my weight. I was now uncontrollably losing weight, and was now down to 140 lbs. and was either gettin extremely light headed, or passing out almost every time I stood up. Finally I was diagnosed with celiac disease, and once on a gluten free diet, I was able to start absorbing nutrition again, and began to gain some weight back, but I still had not been diagnosed with the Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, or my Psoriatic Arthritis. Along with these health issues I was being plagued by neuropathy from the Diabetes, as well as gastroparesis, which is a paralysis of the digestive system, causing problems with digestion and motility. Finally, after a long period of the "why me" syndrome, I began to focus on Personal Development, and Spirituality, which eventually led me to certifications as a Master Life Coach, Happiness Coach, Life Purpose Coach, Professional Life Coach, Goal Setting Coach, as well as an NLP, EFT, Ho'Oponopono, and SFP Practitioner. I started this undertaking simply to learn different tools to shift my mindset, and repurpose my life, but then I realized that I could use that knowledge to help others, and that is where I am today. I have recently returned to the workforce, and am working worard geting my Solar Sales organization, and my Life Coaching business off the ground so I can spend more time doing the things I love, and enjoy every monemt I have left "doing well by doing good"!</p>
            </p>
    <h2>What Makes Me Tick</h2>
        <p>There are actually several parts to the answer to that question. First of all, from a very early age I had  lust for knowledge,  which was strange because I hated school! Later I realized that the reason for that is that things were moving too slowly for me in school. I was grasping the concept quickly and was ready to move on and learn more but the teachers were just teaching too slowly for me. Fortunately my elementary school did have a Scholars Program when they tested me for it. I entered the Scholars Program which was fantastic! One day a week all of the children in the entire School District from all of the elementary schools who were part of the Scholars Program would be bused to one school and would all spend the day learning together in a special classroom with special teachers with different learning methods. It was amazing.  In these classes, starting in the third grade I met a very good friend Bryan,  who is still a very good friend of mine today. From that early age, I always  was looking to learn more about almost anything. I'd get a toy and half the time before I played with it I'd take it apart to find out how it worked. Sometimes I broke them and had to figure out how to fix them, other times I was unable to  fix it, but I enjoyed that.  
         <br>Along with my love of learning, I am fascinated by the human mind. What motivates people? Why do they do the things they do? Because of this I've taken psychology classes, life coaching certification courses,  I've become an NLP practitioner, I practice Ho’oponopono, and am  learning hypnosis! Some of these subjects have always been of interest to me, but if you read my story above, you realize I went through, and am still going through some serious health issues. I took interest in many of these things to get past the victim mentality. It was for my own personal growth and wellbeing. I was looking for anything to help me optimize the way that I lived my life. I needed to stop asking “why me?”,  and change that mentality to “why not me?”!  bad things happen to everyone, what made me so special that I shouldn't suffer just like everyone else does! Through all of these different things that I was teaching myself and reading about I came to realize that the challenges that life puts before us do not Define us, it's how we react to those challenges that defines us. Those aren't obstacles on the road, they are the road,  they are the Stepping Stones to success! I came to realize that, just like everyone else in this world, I am strong enough to handle anything that the universe throws at me. I realized that life is too short to worry about the little things. I want to be able to focus on traveling and living every day as if it was my last. 
        <br>Another thing that those who know me would tell you is that I am a person who likes to help others. Generally if there is anything I can do to help anyone in any situation I will do it if it is at all in my power. If you put these three things together the only logical choice for me moving forward from the illnesses that I've had and trying to get back into the workforce is to use the things I've learned to help others to get past the things that I've managed to get past. So I've decided to hang out my shingle as a life coach and I specialize  in helping people who have lost their ability to function in society the same way that they always have due to illness or disability. I want to help them realize that they're not defined by what they did they are not what they do for a living and help them reconnect to who they are as a person and once they do that we can find a Direction to move them in as far as finding a suitable career path moving forward within their new limitations. They can still live a full happy purposeful life, and I'm making it my mission in life to help them do so!
